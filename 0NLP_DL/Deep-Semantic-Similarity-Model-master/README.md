# Deep Semantic Similarity Model
My Keras implementation of the Deep Semantic Similarity Model (DSSM)/Convolutional Latent Semantic Model (CLSM) described [here](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/226585/cikm2014_cdssm_final.pdf). As search data sets are generally proprietary, you will have to provide your own data to use with the code.
